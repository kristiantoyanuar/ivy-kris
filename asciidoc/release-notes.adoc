= Ivy Release Announcement

XXXX DATE XXXXXX - The Apache Ivy project is pleased to announce its 2.5.0 release.

== What is Ivy?
Apache Ivy is a tool for managing (recording, tracking, resolving and reporting) project dependencies, characterized by flexibility,
configurability, and tight integration with link:https://ant.apache.org/[Apache Ant].

== Download
You can download this release at link:https://ant.apache.org/ivy/download.cgi[]

Issues should either be discussed in the link:https://ant.apache.org/ivy/mailing-lists.html[Ivy user mailing list] or reported at link:https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/IVY[]

More information about the project can be found on the website link:https://ant.apache.org/ivy/[]

== Key features in this release

Key features of this 2.5.0 release are:

    * The minimum runtime Java version required is now Java 7
    * Ivy now uses BouncyCastle OpenPGP API 1.59. Due to the non backward compatibility of that library, earlier versions are not supported.
    * Ivy now uses HttpComponents HttpClient 4.5.x version with HTTP backed resolvers. Users are expected to have this version of the library (and its dependencies) in their runtime classpath if they want to use such resolvers. The previous (similarly named but not the same) commons-httpclient library is no longer used or supported. (jira:IVY-1563[])

- IMPROVEMENT: Update BouncyCastle to 1.59 (jira:IVY-1521[]) (Thanks to Michal Srb)
- IMPROVEMENT: `symlinkmass` option of retrieve task has been deprecated in this release and will no longer be supported since, starting this version of Ivy, Ivy uses Java standard API(s) for symlink management and as such doesn't spawn a process to execute symlink creation shell commands, like it used to do earlier. The `symlinkmass` option was previously there to launch just one single process instead of multiple processes for symlink creation. Now with the usage of the Java standard API(s), this option no longer is relevant.

- IMPROVEMENT: Better thread safety of the resolve process

- NEW: Lets SSH-based resolvers use an `~/.ssh/config` file to find username/hostname/keyfile options (Thanks to Colin Stanfill)
- NEW: Add ivy.maven.lookup.sources and ivy.maven.lookup.javadoc variables to control the lookup of the additional artifacts. Defaults to true, for backward compatibility (jira:IVY-1529[])
- NEW: Add (conditional) support for SHA-256, SHA-512 and SHA-384 checksum algorithms (jira:IVY-1554[]) (Thanks to Jaikiran Pai)
- NEW: The standalone Ivy jar can now be used to generate a pom file for the resolved module, using the `makepom` option (Thanks to link:https://github.com/aanno[Thomas Pasch])
- NEW: The buildlist task can now have `root` and `leaf` subelements to specify the organisation (and other attributes) of the root and leaf modules (jira:/IVY-1242[]) and (jira:IVY-1293[])
